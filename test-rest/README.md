# Example REST API with Lumen

Implementing a simple conversion REST-API with Laravel Lumen.

1. First, update the framework by running `composer install` 
   (for information on Composer see: https://getcomposer.org)
1. Run locally with `php -s localhost:8000 -t public`

Rest API is at `/api/distance/add`. Use a POST call to check for options. Distance units are in `meters` or `yards`
